/*
1. functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.
    A function that is part of a class is called a "method".
    so in Java, all functions are methods.
2. To define a function in Java, we use "public static".
    We will see alternate ways of defining functions later.
3. All parameters of a function must have a declared type,
    and the return value of the function must have a declared type
    Functions in Java return only one value!
